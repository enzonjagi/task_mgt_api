## How to Setup the App
* To be added after the app is deployed
# Creation Process
Steps:
## 1. Set up the development environment:
* Install Flutter SDK and set up your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
* Install Django and set up a virtual environment for Python.
## 2. Frontend Development with Flutter:
* Create a new Flutter project using the Flutter CLI or your IDE.
* Set up the basic app structure, including screens, widgets, and navigation.
* Implement the necessary UI components for task creation, list display, and task details.
* Connect the frontend app to the backend API endpoints.
## 3. Backend Development with Django:
* Create a new Django project using the Django CLI or your IDE.
* Design the data model for tasks and create the necessary Django models.
* Set up Django REST Framework for API development.
* Create API endpoints for task creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion.
* Implement appropriate views and serializers to handle API requests and responses.
## 4. Connect Flutter with Django:
* Use Flutter's http package to send API requests to the Django backend.
* Implement functions to handle tasks like creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting tasks through API calls.
## 5. Test and Debug:
* Test the app functionality on both the frontend and backend to ensure everything is working as expected.
* Debug any issues that arise during testing.
## 6. Deployment:
* Deploy the Django backend on a server of your choice (e.g., Heroku or AWS).
* Build the Flutter app for your target platform (iOS/Android) and deploy it to the respective app stores or use other distribution methods.
## 7. Documentation:
* Document the project, including the technologies used, project structure, and any other relevant information.
* Create a README file that provides instructions on how to set up and run the app.
